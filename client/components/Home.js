      <p>I am a New York based software developer. I have been learning how to code and solve algorithms on my own for the past couple of years and finally decided to persue this carreer. I gradauted from Grace Hopper at Fullsdtack Academy of code and learned to work as a fullstack developer.
      I am experienced with Java Script, React, NERD Stack (Node.js, Express, React, Databases) and I know how to teach myself new technologies.
      I am passionate about what I do and I am motivated by new challanges. Feel free to checkout some of my projects or contact me with any questions.
